# 🧠 GameDev Compilation 2025 – AI, Netcode & Navigation

This part of the Year compilation focuses on advanced gameplay systems—**AI pathfinding, networking, and multiplayer setup**. From working with Photon and NetCode for GameObjects to implementing NavMesh navigation and UI systems, this repo showcases my development in more technical systems behind the scenes.

## 🚀 What I’ve Learned

This phase of development helped me grasp the deeper systems required for real-time gameplay:

- 🔁 **Client-Server Architecture** using NetCode and Photon
- 👾 **AI Navigation** with Unity NavMesh: pathfinding, obstacles, and dynamic agents
- 🎮 **Multiplayer Logic**: Syncing players, managing rooms, and handling authority
- 🧪 **Prefab Management** and shared networking resources
- 🖼️ **UI Scaling** using modern Unity tools
